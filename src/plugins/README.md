# Introduction of plugins and usage information

|------------------------------------------------------------------ |
## Introduction

The monitoring client is composed of 8 plugins, monitoring all kinds of the system infrastructure-level performance and power metrics. The plugins implemented are based on various libraries, system hardware counters and Linux proc filesystem. In addition to be used by the monitoring client, each plugin can be built as a standalone client, being executed alone with given specific metrics name. 

More details about each plugin, for example, the plugins' usage, prerequisites and supported metrics are all clarified in the following.

### List of plugins

- Board_power
- CPU_perf
- CPU_temperature
- FPGA_IO
- Linux_resources
- Linux_sys_power
- Movidius_power
- NVML

|------------------------------------------------------------------ |
## Board_power Plugin

This plugin is based on the external ACME power measurement kit and the libiio library, which is installed during the monitoring client setup process, done automatically by the setup.sh shell script. In case that the ACME power measurement board is not connected with the monitoring client hosted computer or the libiio library is not found, the plugin will fail and report associated error messages.

It is recommended to try the following command to test the ACME power measurement board connection:

```
$ ping baylibre-acme.local
```

### Usage and metrics

The Board_power plugin can be built and ran alone, outside the monitoring framework. In the directory of the plugin, execute the **Makefile** using

```
$ make clean all
```

, before calling the generated sampling client **mf_Board_power_client**, please add the required libraries to the **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** by:

```
$ source setenv.sh
```

It is advised to run the sampling client **mf_Board_power_client** like the follows:

```
$ ./mf_Board_power_client <LIST_OF_Board_power_METRICS>
```

Replace **<LIST_OF_Board_power_METRICS>** with a space-separated list of the following events:

- device0:current
- device0:vshunt
- device0:vbus
- device0:power

Unit and description for each metric is showed in the following table:

| Metrics    | Units    | Description   |
|----------- |--------  |-------------  |
| device0:current | mA | current go throught the Jack probe |
| device0:vshunt  | mV | voltage over the shunt |
